# Arazzo

Arazzo is for web3 blogging.
Get directly onboard with your digital walletðŸ¦Š, then start writing!

Users can :

1) Set permission or encrypt their blog post. Now users can choose to share with a specific wallet or keep it public.
In the future, users can publish a blog with a list of whom can decrypt it, for instance, attach a list of public keys that can read, with options for: nobody(private content), 1 key(~=DM),100 keys(list of tipping fans or NFT holders).
    
2) Manage the publishing in dataverse-os Finders and visulize(monetize) the data generated,

Like how you manage files in Mac FinderðŸ‘‡

_"Come un arazzo, I singoli fili emergono in superficie formando un'immagine per poi rituffarsi di sotto ed eclissarsi."_
